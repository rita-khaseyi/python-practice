# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and
#  then prints out all the even numbers from 1 to that number.

# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints out the factorial of that number using a while loop.
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a password. If the password entered is incorrect, prompt the user to enter it again until the correct password is entered.
# Write a program that generates a random number between 1 and 100 and then prompts the user to guess the number. If the user's guess is too high, print "Too high!" and prompt the user to guess again. If the user's guess is too low, print "Too low!" and prompt the user to guess again. If the user guesses the correct number, print "You win!" and exit the program.
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then calculates and prints the sum of all the numbers from 1 to that number.
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a string and then prints out the string in reverse using a while loop.
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints out all the prime numbers from 1 to that number using a while loop.
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then checks if the number is a palindrome (i.e., reads the same backward as forward) using a while loop.
# Write a program that prompts the user to enter a number and then prints out the corresponding Fibonacci sequence using a while loop.
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a number and keeps asking until they enter a number greater than 10.
